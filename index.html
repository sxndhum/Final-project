              Green Thumb Landscaping got its roots in one of the greenest, most
              picturesque landscapes in the world - Ireland. The lush
              countryside of owner and operator John Duane's homeland is known
              to have "40 Shades of Green". Today, John employs the most
              knowledgeable, capable and hardworking team. Each member
              contributes their own individual talents and strong suits, but
              they all have one thing in common - commitment to providing
              customers with quality products and courteous services. From
              regular lawn maintenance and installing sandstone steps to laying
              simple pathways and designing complex custom yards, our diverse
              team has the qualifications to make your vision reality. We take
              pride in even the smallest project, and are meticulous down to the
              last blade of grass. We take a customer-first approach to
              everything we do. Our team is creative, courteous, thorough and
              efficient, and communicates every step of the way to ensure your
              expectations are met. Green Thumb Landscaping treats outdoor
              spaces like indoor spaces. Rocks and debris are picked up and
              removed, entertaining areas and driveways are blown free of dust
              and dead and decaying vegetation is pruned away. No clean up
              required. When the work is done, the only thing left for you to do
              is kick up your feet and bask in your picture-ready surroundings.
              And you may not even know we were there.

              design and installation, we pride ourselves on doing the job
              right. “John and his crew were very easy to work with and built us
              a fantastic new deck and hot tub. We love it! During the design &
              build phase John was open to new design ideas to incorporate into
              his plan and always took the time to answer my many questions. His
              crew was always polite and cleaned up the site each day before
              they left. I highly recommend them if you are considering a new
              deck for your home.” — Liz O'Brien The state of your landscape

              Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They
              repaired our landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in
              particular, was professional, polite and hardworking. He wanted to
              make sure we were happy with the job every step of the way! Thank
              you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done! Great job

              I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks
              Landscaping Limited for the incredible work they did for my yard
              in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work diligently to
              complete my yard in a timely fashion, they were very nice and
              polite and went out of their way to ensure everything that I asked
              for was done. They were extremely patient with the issues raised
              regarding some of the neighbours concerns. They were also always
              asking me if there was anything more they could do which made me
              feel that they genuinely wanted to do their best work. The
              landscaping crew as a whole was beyond fantastic and extremely
              polite and professional. In particular, I want to thank Matt &
              Jimmy for being outstanding employees.For example, I had mentioned a
              concern about the grass (even though they were not the ones who
              put it in) and the next day they brought new sod in and replaced
              the bad parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad,
              as he too went above and beyond to organize everything I asked
              for. From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up
              with all my changes; he made sure our new yard and deck was taken
              care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I
              appreciate all of the crew’s hard work, and how impressed I am
              with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

              Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping
              happen. I had no clue of how to set up my yard, but they came and
              gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put
              requirements on my property that needed to be met. I was unsure on
              how to meet the requirements and stay within my budget. After a
              brief meeting with a park representative they had created a plan
              that to fulfill the requirements and had booked a time to finish
              the job. A great thing when you are spending so much money is to
              see the crew actually working swiftly and not taking long breaks.
              I would totally recommend Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In
              fact, I did recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went
              with Park because they were able to deliver a prompt and
              professional service. Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job
              well done!

              We were very impressed. We’ve done a lot of work to our home and
              property and this has been by far one of the best experiences!
              They met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The
              planning process was fun, the job started the day we’d planned for
              and the crew was fantastic, working full days until they were
              done, and touching base with me whenever there were decisions to
              be made (no matter how minor). We had a patio area put in for our
              fire pit, added walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding
              area and they levelled the lawn and put down new sod. The work was
              top notch. Even more telling of the high level of professionalism
              is the care they put into follow up. They’ve contacted us, come
              out to the house to take a look after the fact and actually asked
              for feedback to help them do better in the future. I wish all
              companies cared about their craft as much as the team at Green
              Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When we’re ready to tackle the front yard
              we will definitely be working with them again and we would highly
              recommend them to others 🙂
